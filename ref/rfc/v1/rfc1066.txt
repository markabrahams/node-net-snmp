1.  Status of this Memo

   This memo provides the initial version of the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based
   internets in the short-term.  In particular, together with its
   companion memos which describe the structure of management
   information along with the initial network management protocol, these
   documents provide a simple, workable architecture and system for
   managing TCP/IP-based internets and in particular the Internet.

RFC 1066                          MIB                        August 1988


   This memo specifies a draft standard for the Internet community.
   TCP/IP implementations in the Internet which are network manageable
   are expected to adopt and implement this specification.

   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

2.  IAB POLICY STATEMENT

   This MIB specification is the first edition of an evolving document
   defining variables needed for monitoring and control of various
   components of the Internet.  Not all groups of defined variables are
   mandatory for all Internet components.

   For example, the EGP group is mandatory for gateways using EGP but
   not for hosts which should not be running EGP.  Similarly, the TCP
   group is mandatory for hosts running TCP but not for gateways which
   aren't running it.  What IS mandatory, however, is that all variables
   of a group be supported if any element of the group is supported.

   It is expected that additional MIB groups and variables will be
   defined over time to accommodate the monitoring and control needs of
   new or changing components of the Internet.  The MIB working group
   will continue to refine this specification and projects a revision
   incorporating new requirements in early 1989.

3.  Introduction

   As reported in RFC 1052, IAB Recommendations for the Development of
   Internet Network Management Standards [1], the Internet Activities
   Board has directed the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to
   create two new working groups in the area of network management.  One
   group is charged with the further specification and definition of
   elements to be included in the Management Information Base.  The
   other is charged with defining the modifications to the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to accommodate the short-term
   needs of the network vendor and operator communities.  The long-term
   needs of the Internet community are to be met using the ISO CMIS/CMIP
   [2,3] framework as a basis.  An existing IETF working group, the
   "NETMAN" group, is already engaged in defining the use of CMIS/CMIP
   in a TCP/IP network, and will continue with responsibility for
   addressing the longer-term requirements.

   The output of the MIB working group is to be provided to both  the
   SNMP working  group  and  the  NETMAN group, so as to ensure
   compatibility of monitored items for both network management
   frameworks.

   The MIB working group has produced this memo and a companion.  The

RFC 1066                          MIB                        August 1988


   companion memo [4] defines a Structure for Management Information
   (SMI) for use by the managed objects contained in the MIB.  This memo
   defines the list of managed objects.

   The IAB also urged the working groups to be "extremely sensitive to
   the need to keep SNMP simple," and recommends that the MIB working
   group take as its starting inputs the MIB definitions found in the
   High-Level Entity Management Systems (HEMS) RFC 1024 [5], the initial
   SNMP specification [6], and the CMIS/CMIP memos [7,8].

   Thus, the list of managed objects defined here, has been derived by
   taking only those elements which are considered essential.  Since
   such elements are essential, there is no need to allow the
   implementation of individual objects, to be optional.  Rather, all
   compliant implementations will contain all applicable (see below)
   objects defined in this memo.

   This approach of taking only the essential objects is NOT
   restrictive, since the SMI defined in the companion memo provides
   three extensibility mechanisms: one, the addition of new standard
   objects through the definitions of new versions of the MIB; two, the
   addition of widely-available but non-standard objects through the
   multilateral subtree; and three, the addition of private objects
   through the enterprises subtree. Such additional objects can not only
   be used for vendor-specific elements, but also for experimentation as
   required to further the knowledge of which other objects are
   essential.

   The primary criterion for being considered essential was for an
   object to be contained in all of the above referenced MIB
   definitions.  A few other objects have been included, but only if the
   MIB working group believed they are truly essential.  The detailed
   list of criteria against which potential inclusions in this (initial)
   MIB were considered, was:

      1) An object needed to be essential for either fault or
         configuration management.

      2) Only weak control objects were permitted (by weak, it
         is meant that tampering with them can do only limited
         damage).  This criterion reflects the fact that the
         current management protocols are not sufficiently secure
         to do more powerful control operations.

      3) Evidence of current use and utility was required.

      4) An attempt was made to limit the number of objects to
         about 100 to make it easier for vendors to fully

         instrument their software.

      5) To avoid redundant variables, it was required that no
         object be included that can be derived from others in the
         MIB.

      6) Implementation specific objects (e.g., for BSD UNIX)
         were excluded.

      7) It was agreed to avoid heavily instrumenting critical
         sections of code.  The general guideline was one counter
         per critical section per layer.

4.  Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [9].

   The mechanisms used for describing these objects are specified in the
   companion memo.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and
   an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an administratively
   assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The object type
   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
   refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the companion memo purposely restricts the
   ASN.1 constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are
   explicitly made for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.  This memo
   specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [10].

4.1.  Object Groups

   Since this list of managed objects contains only the essential
   elements, there is no need to allow individual objects to be
   optional.  Rather, the objects are arranged into the following
   groups:

                  - System
                  - Interfaces
                  - Address Translation
                  - IP
                  - ICMP
                  - TCP
                  - UDP
                  - EGP

   There are two reasons for defining these groups: one, to provide a
   means of assigning object identifiers; two, to provide a method for
   implementations of managed agents to know which objects they must
   implement.  This method is as follows: if the semantics of a group is
   applicable to an implementation, then it must implement all objects



McCloghrie & Rose                                               [Page 5]

RFC 1066                          MIB                        August 1988


   in that group.  For example, an implementation must implement the EGP
   group if and only if it implements the EGP protocol.

4.2.  Format of Definitions

   The next section contains the specification of all object types
   contained in the MIB. Following the conventions of the companion
   memo, the object types are defined using the following fields:

          OBJECT:
          -------
               A textual name, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, for the
               object type, along with its corresponding OBJECT
               IDENTIFIER.

          Syntax:
               The abstract syntax for the object type, presented using
               ASN.1.  This must resolve to an instance of the ASN.1
               type ObjectSyntax defined in the SMI.

          Definition:
               A textual description of the semantics of the object
               type.  Implementations should ensure that their
               interpretation of the object type fulfills this
               definition since this MIB is intended for use in multi-
               vendor environments.  As such it is vital that object
               types have consistent meaning across all machines.

          Access:
               One of read-only, read-write, write-only, or
               not-accessible.

          Status:
              One of mandatory, optional, or obsolete.

               (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means
               for determining "what kind of box" is being managed.  For
               example, if vendor "Flintstones, Inc." was assigned the
               subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.42, it could assign the identifier
               1.3.6.1.4.1.42.1.1 to its "Fred Router".

5.3.  The Address Translation Group

   Implementation of the Address Translation group is mandatory
   for all systems.

   The Address Translation group contains one table which is the
   union across all interfaces of the translation tables for
   converting a NetworkAddress (e.g., an IP address) into a
   subnetwork-specific address.  For lack of a better term, this
   document refers to such a subnetwork-specific address as a
   "physical" address.

   Examples of such translation tables are: for broadcast media
   where ARP is in use, the translation table is equivalent to
   the ARP cache; or, on an X.25 network where non-algorithmic
   translation to X.121 addresses is required, the translation
   table contains the NetworkAddress to X.121 address
   equivalences.

          Definition:
               The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress
               to "physical" address equivalences.  Some interfaces do
               not use translation tables for determining address
               equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method);
               if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address
               Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.

5.4.2.  The IP Routing Table

   The IP Routing Table contains an entry for each route
   presently known to this entity.  Note that the action to be
   taken in response to a request to read a non-existent entry,
   is specific to the network management protocol being used.

5.6.  The TCP Group

   Implementation of the TCP group is mandatory for all systems
   that implement the TCP protocol.

   Note that instances of object types that represent information
   about a particular TCP connection are transient; they persist
   only as long as the connection in question.

                       vanj(4)      -- Van Jacobson's algorithm [11]
                  }

             Definition:
                  The algorithm used to determine the timeout value used
                  for retransmitting unacknowledged octets.

             Definition:
                  The minimum value permitted by a TCP implementation
                  for the retransmission timeout, measured in
                  milliseconds.  More refined semantics for objects
                  of this type depend upon the algorithm used to
                  determine the retransmission timeout.  In particular,
                  when the timeout algorithm is rsre(3), an object
                  of this type has the semantics of the LBOUND
                  quantity described in RFC 793.
